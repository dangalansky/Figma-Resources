Figma

saving:

- saved on cloud, live

to save locally:

- file > save local copy
	*.fig = figma filetype

- file > show version history (saves 30 days for free) > click “+”
	—> name your current version

- you can visit by choosing “duplicate”; non-destructive

*** if you restore a version, future revisions are overwritten

Naming Conventions

- best practice is to use forward slashes 

ex) Button / Large / Dark

ex) Card / Small / Light

etc…

- forward slashes out-create multi-dimensional variations for component groups 


terms:

* persona —> fictional client we are developing a product for 

* task flow —> simple a-z linear flow

*user flow —> different ways of getting to same ends, involves interactions and decisions, more like a flow chart


* Wireframe —> loFi, outline of positioning of assets

* HiFi —> images and assets are positioned and formatted properly

shortcuts:

- magical search everything
	cmd + /

- to round single corner:
	option + drag

- to repeat action
	cmd + D

- change view to 100%
	cmd + 0

- change view to see ALL
	shift + 1

- zoom into selected element
	shift + 2

- select element from within group, frame or object
	cmd + click

- scale up/down stroke and text
	K (for scale tool)

- switch from frame/group and vise versa
	select frame, click group from drop down on upper right 

- grid/column hide/show
	cntl + G

- cut and paste formatting
	click to left until feature is highlighted + copy and paste on new frame

Frames ### !
- similar to group but exists independently of objects!
- clip content for masking / to add scroll functionality 
- constraints to keep elements stuck to certain areas of frame

note: nested frames are not auto named 

Components
- divided into master and components
* components are reusable “objects”

* the master is the original
	—> changing the master changes all “instances” 


- instances can be uniquely affected, or “overridden” 

* to take component from community + make local
	copy + paste > detach instance > make component  

* to push changes to master from instance
	right click > main component > push overrides to main component

* to change back to original state
	right click > “reset all overrides”

* to break instance from master
	right click > detach instance

* to find master
	right click > component > go to main component 

* if you’ve deleted master…
	right click component instance > main component > restore main component 

Variable Components
* a collection of components with variations 

- to create variants
	select multiple “main” components > select “combine as variants” from right panel

- to use:
	select instance > choose property under variants in right panel 

Toggles!
when a variable set is created:

	- naming the main components inside either:
		- on / off
		- true / false

	** creates special scenario where the instances will work like toggles!

Forms

* do not use stylized text; text entry should be boring and trustworthy 


Pages
- for separating ideas (mobile vs. desktop etc.)

Properties

- to set default 
	- select object > edit > set default properties

- to copy and paste properties
	select object > edit > copy properties > select object > paste properties 

Icons
- free for commercial use
- svg file!

Smart Animation

- duplicate screen
- move object off original screen
- in layers: drag object back into frame

note: object must have same name between frames!

Color Palettes
1.  draw square frames > use eyedropper to fill > start with 3
2.  primary color, secondary color, accent color
3.  copy twice, using HSB, make one darker and one brighter 
4.  create a black to white scale
	- white should be slightly off-white (to contrast in case its placed on white)
	- black should be a blackish version of the primary color
	- create shades towards white by experimenting with up/left until you hit whitest color

Color Styles
* allows to save colors in project & change all uses quickly!

￼ < — this is the styles indicator!

- choose color and click indicator, save as project name, primary/secondary, number etc.

Fonts
- sizing —> 72(H1), 48(H2), 32(H3), 24(H4), 18(H5), 16(P1)
	* based on 1 em = 16pt

- standard leading size is 1/2 the font size

Character Styles
- transfers font, size, leading, kerning, weight
	NOT COLOR tho… 

- you might pick 2 styles for a brand 
	- marketing messaging vs. information

Boolean Operations
* must select all shapes involved, shapes are still separately editable

-union - joins shapes into 1

-subtract - subtracts top shape from bottom shape

-intersect - only overlap between shapes is left

-exclude - everything but overlap is left and joined into single shape 

* flatten —> unifies shapes for good; destructive 


Images

*cropping = masking!

	to manual crop:
	—> image must be on top of shape to mask
	—> click moon-looking icon at top of page ￼

	or:
	—> select shape fill and change to image
	—> crop option allows for formatting and positioning within shape

	or:
	—> import image and choose fill options
	—> select crop etc

	for text as mask:
	—> place text under image!	
	—> to edit text: select text element inside mask, select text tool and retype

Constraints

- connects any child element to parent
- designated by dotted line outside box, if set

Effects
* you can and should apply more than 1 shadow layer
* goal should be sublty
	—> no one should notice!

Blur
* use blur image to fake depth and field
	- under effects: layer blur
	- more blur to denote further in background

* use blur to make text more readable
	- add shape, make transparent, add background blur


Neumorphic Design
* poor design for accessibility but…

—> background cannot be black or white

for extruding buttons
- 2 black to bottom right
	- 1 should be wafty and blurry (try blackish at 50%, x6, y6, blur = 10-16)
	- 1 should be tight and defined

-2 white to top left
	- try white at 50%, x-6, y-6. blur = 10-15
	- 1 tight 


Buttons

* for buttons that change size as you type

1. create button + text
	- make sure text is set to auto width, not fixed size
2. frame both
3. add auto layout on right 
	- this removes rectangle, turns into parent frame
	- text becomes child
4. add padding into parent frame

* for buttons that stretch while text remains in place

1. create button + text
	- in this case fixed size is ok
2. frame both
3. add auto layout
4. select alignment properties as needed (center, top left, etc.)

* make button out of fill around text
1. type words
2. frame selection
3. add auto layout
4. add padding
5. create curved corners, if desired

1. Creating a Wireframe

- homepage —> new design file —> # frame icon —> drag to size OR choose size 
	*iphone 8 is fairly generic

- font size must be chosen at 100% preview size

- font itself should be without character!!!!

2. Creating a Prototype (Basic)

- switch from “Design” to  “Prototype” in upper right
- draw arrows to connect frames
- click “present” in upper right corner. 

3. Moodboard (HiFi)

(search UI Kit on: dribbble, behance, etc…)
(best design on screens on pttrns, awwwards, cssdesignawards, onepagelove )
- screenshots
- moodboard for self
	- messy fine!
- moodboard for stakeholders
	- use template from Figma

4. HiFi Prototyping

* web design
	- set up frame > establish 12 columns (under grid) > gutter standard = 24 (divisible by 8)
	*for mobile: 6 columns (divisible by 12) > gutter = 16 (divisible by 8)

	- for desktop: margin (try 80?); mobile: (try 16)

* app design
	-set up frame > establish grid (8 is common!)
