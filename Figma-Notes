Frames ### !
- similar to group but exists independently of objects!
- clip content for masking / to add scroll functionality 
- constraints to keep elements stuck to certain areas of frame

note: nested frames are not auto named 

Pages
- for separating ideas (mobile vs. desktop etc.)

Properties

	- select object > edit > set default properties

- to copy and paste properties
	select object > edit > copy properties > select object > paste properties 

Icons
- free for commercial use
- svg file!

Smart Animation

- duplicate screen
- move object off original screen
- in layers: drag object back into frame

note: object must have same name between frames!

Color Palettes
1.  draw square frames > use eyedropper to fill > start with 3
2.  primary color, secondary color, accent color
3.  copy twice, using HSB, make one darker and one brighter 
4.  create a black to white scale
	- white should be slightly off-white (to contrast in case its placed on white)
	- black should be a blackish version of the primary color
	- create shades towards white by experimenting with up/left until you hit whitest color

Color Styles
* allows to save colors in project & change all uses quickly!

￼ < — this is the styles indicator!

- choose color and click indicator, save as project name, primary/secondary, number etc.

Fonts
- sizing —> 72(H1), 48(H2), 32(H3), 24(H4), 18(H5), 16(P1)
	* based on 1 em = 16pt

- standard leading size is 1/2 the font size

Character Styles
- transfers font, size, leading, kerning, weight
	NOT COLOR tho… 

- you might pick 2 styles for a brand 
	- marketing messaging vs. information

Boolean Operations
* must select all shapes involved, shapes are still separately editable

-union - joins shapes into 1

-subtract - subtracts top shape from bottom shape

-intersect - only overlap between shapes is left

-exclude - everything but overlap is left and joined into single shape 

* flatten —> unifies shapes for good; destructive 


1. Creating a Wireframe

- homepage —> new design file —> # frame icon —> drag to size OR choose size 
	*iphone 8 is fairly generic

- font size must be chosen at 100% preview size

- font itself should be without character!!!!

2. Creating a Prototype (Basic)

- switch from “Design” to  “Prototype” in upper right
- draw arrows to connect frames
- click “present” in upper right corner. 

3. Moodboard (HiFi)

(search UI Kit on: dribbble, behance, etc…)
(best design on screens on pttrns, awwwards, cssdesignawards, onepagelove )
- screenshots
- moodboard for self
	- messy fine!
- moodboard for stakeholders
	- use template from Figma

4. HiFi Prototyping

* web design
	- set up frame > establish 12 columns (under grid) > gutter standard = 24 (divisible by 8)
	*for mobile: 6 columns (divisible by 12) > gutter = 16 (divisible by 8)

	- for desktop: margin (try 80?); mobile: (try 16)

* app design
	-set up frame > establish grid (8 is common!)
